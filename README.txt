1. Read about blockchain technology if you are not already familiar with it.

2. Then read about smart contracts in general :

3. Then dive into Ethereum smart contracts as most of our research focuses on that:
https://www.coindesk.com/information/ethereum-smart-contracts-work

4. Our research is about finding a tool that scans and analyzes smart contracts for potential bugs and vulnerabilities so I would suggest you to look into the known vulnerabilities of smart contracts:

5. hopefully by now you have a good understanding of smart contracts and you can read about M_pro, a tool designed to analyze smart contracts which I have attached (This can be a bit technical so don't worry if you don't understand the whole thing)

6. get familiar with solidity and javascript 

7. (Optional readings) : If you want to have more readings you could also take a look at ZEUS and verx, EXE and contract fuzzer papers.
